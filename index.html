	<h2>Tutorial</h2>
	<p>
		This page present a simple example of MVC applied. 
		MVC stands for Model-View-Controller.
		All web page functionalities are divided in separated components, 
		these components collaborates in order to provide a the web-app behaviour/view.
		Although it seems that it is more complex to build, 
		it structures components with high cohesion and low coupling, so
		in large term, it is easier to add and change behaviour/views.
	</p>

	<h3>Model</h3>
	<p>
		Model is basically data. It can be something that can be read from the server,
		user preferences, a list of things, a thing, information about which button is pushed...
		We can see it as just JSON: 
	</p>
	<code>
{ 
    "name": "John",
    "surname": "Smith", 
}
	</code>
	<p>
		In addition, models also can have functions to provide some queries:
	</p>
	<code>
{ 
    name: 'John',
    surname: 'Smith', 
    getFullName: function() {
        return this.name +' '+ this.surname;
    },
}
	</code>
	<p>
		Models can be categorized by kind, each kind of model has its own fields and
		supporting functions. We should create a component to handle each kind of model.
		An example of model should be:
	</p>
	<code>
function User(data) {
	this.name = data.name;
	this.surname = data.surname;
}
User.getFullName = function() {
    return this.name +' '+ this.surname;
};
	</code>
	<p>
		When a new model is created it just is instanced from the model. Example:
	</p>
	<code>
// create
var johnSmith = new User({
    name: 'John',
    surname: 'Smith', 
});

// and use
console.log(johnSmith.getFullName());
	</code>
	<p>Full examples are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>jQuery: <a href="jquery/Model.js">auxiliary class</a>, <a href="jquery/UserModel.js">user model</a></li>
		<li>Angular: <a href="angular/UserModel.js">user model</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p><emph>Note</emph>: in jQuery there is an auxiliary class because models needs to be watched</p>
