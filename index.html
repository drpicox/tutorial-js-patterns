	<h2>Tutorial</h2>
	<p>
		This page present a simple example of MVC applied. 
		MVC stands for Model-View-Controller.
		All web page functionalities are divided in separated components, 
		these components collaborates in order to provide a the web-app behaviour/view.
		Although it seems that it is more complex to build, 
		it structures components with high cohesion and low coupling, so
		in large term, it is easier to add and change behaviour/views.
	</p>


	<h3>Model</h3>
	<p>
		Model is basically data. It can be something that can be read from the server,
		user preferences, a list of things, a thing, information about which button is pushed, etc.
		We can see it as just JSON: 
	</p>
	<code>
{ 
    "name": "John",
    "surname": "Smith", 
}
	</code>
	<p>
		In addition, models also can have functions to provide some queries:
	</p>
	<code>
{ 
    name: 'John',
    surname: 'Smith', 
    getFullName: function() {
        return this.name +' '+ this.surname;
    },
}
	</code>
	<p>
		Models can be categorized by kind, each kind of model has its own fields and
		supporting functions. We should create a component to handle each kind of model.
		An example of model should be:
	</p>
	<code>
function User(data) {
	this.name = data.name;
	this.surname = data.surname;
}
User.getFullName = function() {
    return this.name +' '+ this.surname;
};
	</code>
	<p>
		When a new model is created it just is instanced from the model. Example:
	</p>
	<code>
// create
var johnSmith = new User({
    name: 'John',
    surname: 'Smith', 
});

// and use
console.log(johnSmith.getFullName());
	</code>
	<p>Full examples are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>jQuery: <a href="jquery/Model.js">auxiliary class</a>, <a href="jquery/UserModel.js">user model</a></li>
		<li>Angular: <a href="angular/UserModel.js">user model</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p><emph>Note</emph>: in jQuery there is an auxiliary class because models needs to be watched</p>


	<h3>View</h3>
	<p>
		View is basically html. View is what is shown to the user, and what the user can use to interact.
		View presents model information (watches models for changes), and captures events so some
		kind of interaction can be performed on model.
	</p>
	<code>
&lt;div>
	&lt;span class="bind-user-name">&lt;/span>&lt;br>
	&lt;span class="bind-user-surname">&lt;/span>&lt;br>
	&lt;button class="action-send-hello">&lt;/button>
&lt;/div>
	</code>
	<p>
		A plain html needs a Javascript to link models and events to the html:
	</p>
	<code>
function UserHelloView(data) {
	$.extend(this, data);	
}
UserHelloView.prototype.link = function (dom) {
	var view = this;
	// update html with changes in the user
	view.user.observe(function(user) {
		$('.bind-user-name').text(user.name);
		$('.bind-user-surname').text(user.surname);		
	});
	// listen for events
	$('.action-send-hello').click(function() {
		view.sendHello();
	});
},
	</code>
	<p>
		The view Javascript part has an interface which can be used directly by controllers.
		The view itself never will use a controller directly (only via callbacks, like <emph>sendHelo</emph>).
		Look to View Controllers for more information.
	</p>
	<p>Full examples are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>jQuery: <a href="jquery/UserFormView.js">user form view</a></li>
		<li>Angular: <a href="angular/UserFormView.html">user form view</a></li>
	</ul>


	<h3>Controllers</h3>
	<p>
		Controllers are everything else. Is what prepares views, loads data, saves values, 
		handles events reactions, etc. Usually they are confused as simple view controllers,
		but if you want to have high cohesion and low coupling you should consider specialized
		kinds of controllers: View Controllers, Flow/Route Controllers, Storage Controllers, ...
	</p>

	<h3>View Controllers</h3>
	<p>
		A view controller is a controller that instances a view, sets up this view, and 
		shows it to the user.
		This is how the controller sets up a view (remember that view provides an interface):
	</p>
	<code>
// controller code setting up a view
view = new UserHelloView();
view.user = UserService.get(userId);
view.sendHello = function() {
	UserWaver.sendHello(userId);
};
view.link(currentDom);
	</code>
	<p>Full examples are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>jQuery: <a href="jquery/UserFormViewController.js">user form view controller</a></li>
		<li>Angular: <a href="angular/UserFormViewDirective.html">user form view directive</a> (a controller)</li>
	</ul>
